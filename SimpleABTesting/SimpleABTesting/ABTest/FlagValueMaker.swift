/**
 Common types that can be transformed from a String value.
 
 This is used specifically by the `Flag` to convert a value from the server into its respective value.
 
 There is an assumption that the only types that will be used for flags are `Bool`s, `String`s, `Int`s, and `Double`s.
 
 Enums should have their own mapper and could use `init(rawValue:)` if they are `RawRepresentable`.
 
 Please note that `String` doesn't need to be a `FlagValueMaker` as the value is a `String` will pass the `value as? T` condition in `Flag.setValue(_:)`.
